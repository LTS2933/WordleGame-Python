# WordleGame-Python

Built to aid in my Python profiency, this app runs smoothly in a programmer's development environment. 
Rather than implementing a UI, which I plan to do sometime to build a more legitimate clone, the program uses
ANSI escape codes to color which letters are in the correct spot, incorrect spot, or not contained within
the word altogether. Enjoy playing!
